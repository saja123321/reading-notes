### JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
----------------


|    Operator     |  Example       |    same as    |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
|       =         |     x = y      |     x = y     |
|       +=        |     x =+y      |    x = x + y  |
|       -=        |     x =-y      |    x = x - y  |
|       *=        |     x =*y      |    x = x * y  |
|       /=        |     x /= y     |    x = x / y  |
|       %=        |     x %= y     |    x = x % y  |
|       **=       |     x **= y    |    x = x ** y |


### JAVASCRIPT COMPARISON OPERATORS

|    Operator    |  Description                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
|       ==       |          equal to                        |
|       ===      |    equal value and equal type            |
|       !=       |            not equal                     |
|       !==      |     not equal value or not equal type    |
|       >        |          greater than                    |
|       <        |             less than                    |
|       >=       |        greater than or equal to          |
|       <=       |       less than or equal to              |


## JAVASCRIPT Loops

      JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
      for - loops through a block of code a number of times
      for/in - loops through the properties of an object
      for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
      while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
      do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true



### For Loop
 
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

#### syntax:
 
```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
// code block to be executed
}
```

1. _**Statement 1**_ is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

2. _**Statement 2**_ defines the condition for executing the code block.

3. _**Statement 3**_ is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.



### The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Syntax

```

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

```
