## Html  Links 
`<a>` used to add a link in a html page he `href` attribute specifies the location a user will be taken to when they click the link. any text Between the `<a>` and closing `</a>` will be shown to the user as a link.

### `<a>` Syntax 
-----

   `<a href="www.google.com"> google </a>`

the result will be 

----------
  
  <a href="www.google.com"> Google </a>

-------------

this is how to link to to any website but what if you want to linking to other pages within the same site, You can use ***relative URL***.

### So what is the ***relative URL***

If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file. Because you do not need to repeat the domain name in each link, they are also quicker to
write.

### Haw can we add an email link 

 to use `<a>` as an email link you need to use  mailto: email address along with href attribute. it will open a new email message and address it to the person specified in the link.

### how  can we add Link to a Specific Part of this Page

by calling `#id` of the element or a sub page in the `href`
