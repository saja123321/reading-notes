# The JavaScript Call Stack

# What is a ‘call’ AND How many ‘calls’ can happen at once ?

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

# What does LIFO mean?

### Last In, First Out

**LIFO:** When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

this is an example of that

# What causes a stack overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

example :

```
function callMyself(){
  callMyself();
}

callMyself();
```

The `callMyself()` will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a _`stack overflow.`_
