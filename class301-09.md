# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which it is tried to bind each and everything in pure mathematical functions. It is a declarative type of programming style that focuses on what to solve rather than how to solve (aimed by the imperative style of programming).

- ### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  Pure functions have two important properties, they:

  - Always produce the same output with the same arguments disregard of other factors. This property is also known as immutability

  - **deterministic.** Pure functions either give some output or modify any argument or global variables i.e. they have no side-effects

```
pure functions make writing concurrent applications easier.

When the code is written using the functional programming style, a capable compiler is able to:

- Memorize the results
- Parallelize the instructions
- Wait for evaluating results
```

### What are the benefits of a pure function?

One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments.

### What is Referential transparency?

**Referential Transparency**

Variables once defined in a functional programming language aren’t allowed to change the value that they are holding throughout the execution of the program. This is known as referential transparency. It assures that the same language expression gives the same output.

Functional programs don’t have any assignment statements. For storing additional values in a program developed using functional programming, new variables must be defined. State of a variable in such a program is constant at any moment in time.

# Node.js Module

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

The require() function will return an object, function, property or any other JavaScript type, depending on what the specified module returns.

```

var module = require('module_name');

```
