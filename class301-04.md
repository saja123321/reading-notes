# Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

Since the `value` attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be `this.state`.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.


### HTML `textarea`

```
<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>
```

In React, a` <textarea>` uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a `<textarea>` can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:

```
class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Essay:
          <textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice that `this.state.value` is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.

# Why would we use a ternary operator?

First, we’ll take a look at the syntax of a typical `if statement`:
```
if ( condition ) {
  value if true;
} else {
  value if false;
}
```

Now, the `ternary operator`:

```
condition ? value if true : value if false
```

Here’s what you need to know:
1. The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
1. A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
1. Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.
