# What are component lifecycle events?

 __Components go through a lifecycle of events__

 1. Mounting (adding nodes to the DOM)
 1. Updating (altering existing nodes in the DOM)
 1. Unmounting (removing nodes from the DOM)
 1. Error handling (verifying that your code works and is bug-free)

__Let’s look at a simple example.__

first lits creat an welcome component 
```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
   render() {
    return <h1> Welcome to my app </h1> 
   }
}

```

the result will be like this

### Before rendering, the component will have 

1. **Mounting phase** a component is like bringing a newborn baby into the world. This is the component’s first glimpse of life. At this phase, the component, which consists of your code and React’s internals, is then inserted into the DOM.

1. **Updating phase** . Without updates, the component would remain as it was when it was initially created in the DOM.
 As you might imagine, many of the components you write till need to be updated ,  whether via a change in state or props. Consequently, they go through the updating phase as well.

 1.  **unmounting phase**. At this stage, the component “dies”. In React lingo, it is removed from  the DOM.

`
 There’s one more phase a React component can go through: the error handling phase. This occurs when your code doesn’t run or there’s a bug somewhere. Think of it like an annual physical.`
