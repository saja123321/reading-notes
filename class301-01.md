# creating a React component 

We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

``` 
class className extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return anyThing ;
  }
}
```
#### Component Constructor

```
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
}

```

-----------------------------------------
## What is Props?

__`Props`__ is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### Example using react 

``` 
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

__`It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.`__
