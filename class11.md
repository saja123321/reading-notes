# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

## Seven Key Places Keywords
### 1. Page Title

***The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the `<title>` element which lives
inside the `<head>` element.***

### 2. URL / Web Address

***The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.***

### 3. Headings
***If the keywords are in a heading
`<hn>` element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.***

### 4. Text
***Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.***

### 5. Link Text
***Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").***

### 6. Image Alt Text
***Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.***

### 7. Page Descriptions
***The description also lives inside
the `<head>` element and is
specified using a `<meta>` tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)
Never try to fool search engines!
They will penalize you for it. For
example, never add text in the
same color as the background of
the page as they can detect this.***
