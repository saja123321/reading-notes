the development of fundamental abilities of any person comes by perseverance and efforts. and when you love what you learn you can achieve the growth of mindset.
 when you facing challenges you must be looking for many solutions, not a unique solution, in addition to finding the solution to the problem you should search for the head cause of the problem, and thinking about the problem in many aspects.
