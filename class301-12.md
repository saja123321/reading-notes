### - What is a status code 202

request was successfully processed and it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.

### - What is a status code 308?

This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.

```
403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
```
