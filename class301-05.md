# How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.

   # What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

    that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, ___don’t use state at all to build this static version.___ State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

# Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:

###  - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
### - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
### - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? 


# Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

For each piece of state in your application:

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

- ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
- The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
- It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable
