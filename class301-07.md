- ## Who is “Roy Fielding”?

Roy Fielding is Someone who is smart.
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## Difference between `PUT`, `POST`, `GET` and `PATCH` IN HTTP Verbs?

The most commonly used HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT, DELETE are similar to CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations in database. We specify these HTTP verbs in the capital case. So, the below is the comparison between them.

1. **GET** :
   `GET` is the simplest type of HTTP request method; the one that browsers use each time you click a link or type a URL into the address bar. It instructs the server to transmit the data identified by the URL to the client. Data should never be modified on the server side as a result of a `GET` request. In this sense, a `GET` request is read-only.

1. **POST**:
   The POST verb is mostly utilized to create new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource.
   On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

1. **PUT**:
   `PUT` is most-often utilized for update capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.
   Checking with Fiddler or PostMan: We can use Fiddler for checking the response. Open Fiddler and select the Compose tab. Specify the verb and url as shown below and click Execute to check the response.

1. **PATCH**: Submits a partial modification to a resource. If you only need to update one field for the resource, you may want to use the `PATCH` method.
